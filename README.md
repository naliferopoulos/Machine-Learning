# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning Project (Bayes/KNN Classifiers)

This project is the work of myself and Georgina Karakasilioti [www.github.com/baby-pink] and was created during our 5th semester at Athens University of Economics and Bussiness, during our BSc studies. It includes an implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier as well as a k-Nearest-Neighbours Classifier, both trained by a data-set in CSV format. It also includes a front-end for querying both classifiers. Both classifiers are built in Java and tested on Debian Linux as well as Windows platforms. Use *make* for easy compilation, running and cleaning of the project. 

# Makefile targets

### *make bayes*
Compiles the Naive Bayes Classifier.

### *make knn*
Compiles the k-Nearest-Neighbours Classifier.

### *make runBayes*
Runs the Naive Bayes Classifier using *training.csv* for training data.

### *make runKnn*
Runs the k-Nearest-Neighbours Classifier using *training.csv* for training data.

### *make usageBayes*
Prints usage message for the Naive Bayes Classifier.

### *make usageKnn*
Prints usage message for the k-Nearest-Neighbours Classifier.

### *make clean*
Cleans the project.
