# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning Project (Bayes/KNN Classifiers)

This project is the work of myself and Georgina Karakasilioti and was created during our 5th semester at Athens University of Economics and Bussiness, during our BSc studies. It includes an implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier as well as a k-Nearest-Neighbours Classifier, both trained by a data-set in CSV format. It also includes a front-end for querying both classifiers. Both classifiers are built in Java and tested on Debian Linux as well as Windows platforms. Use *make* for easy compilation, running and cleaning of the project. 

# Makefile targets

## make bayes
Compiles the Naive Bayes Classifier.

## make knn
Compiles the k-Nearest-Neighbours Classifier.

## make runBayes
Runs the Naive Bayes Classifier using *training.csv* for training data.

## make runKnn
Runs the k-Nearest-Neighbours Classifier using *training.csv* for training data.


## make usageBayes
Prints usage message for the Naive Bayes Classifier.

## make usageKnn
Prints usage message for the k-Nearest-Neighbours Classifier.

## make clean
Cleans the project.
